# MANUAL SETUP

In order to manually setup this environment properly sync these files:

## st terminal
st is setup to use a custom font: [Luxi Mono](https://fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Luxi-Mono)

## i3status.conf
Setting up i3status.conf should be done via cp and not a symlink and update the interface names.
